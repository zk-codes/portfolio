                <p>I've always loved being surrounded by plants, spending time in wild places, and exploring parks. Given I like a wandering life, gardening hasn't been something I thought I'd find interesting.</p>
                <p>But as I've gotten older, and unlearned many of the restrictive self-imposed rules I made to cope as a kid... I've discovered a love for tending to plants. Granted, it's a couple of indoor plants and a few outdoor succulents, but... I love it all the same.</p>
                <p>Having life indoors brings so much joy it's hard to explain...</p>
                <p>Often the simplest things in life bring us the most pleasure, right? That's a lesson I'd have to spend my entire life re-learning. Like with yourself, being impatient at a plant for growing too slowly is pointless.</p>
                <p>Growth takes time, persistence, care, and understanding.</p>
                <p>We're more alike than you might first think.</p>
                <p>When I'm older, I'll have a garden. Full of happy plants and people.</p>

                        <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
