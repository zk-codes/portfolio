                <p>I've been fortunate enough to visit many countries. Mexico, Spain, Italy, Romania, Japan, Taiwan, the UK, the Netherlands and Thailand.</p>
                <p>Each has taught me so much about history, culture, people, and myself.</p>
                <p>And yet... I still yearn.</p>
                <p>I think if you get to travel and you enjoy it, the desire grabs you by the throat and never lets go. Wanderlust, they call it, which is apt, because it's an all-consuming desire.</p>
                <p>It beckons you along to your next port of call, where it inspires you to immerse yourself for months at a time, if you can. Stay, appreciate, learn, discover, explore, and live as if you'd always been there, but through the eyes of an outside newcomer. This is how you find yourself and the world, and this is how you realize though we're all so different, we're alike in many ways.</p>
                <p>Different people and cultures show you there's no one right way of living or experiencing or thinking or being in the world. And just when you think you know all the right words, the way through the streets, the best spots for food and friends, and you feel like this could be home...</p>
                <p>Well, then the call comes, to take you away with it.</p>
                <p>And you're gone, again.</p>

                        <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
