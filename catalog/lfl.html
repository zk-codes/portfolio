                <p>You can use many metaphors to describe books, but I'll choose this one: a letter for the longhaul. Why? Let me explain.</p>
                <p>Many have likened books to portals or time machines, for good reason. They allow us to have experiences we'd never have otherwise, convene with the greatest minds of centuries past, and discover a perspective that makes us see the world anew.</p>
                <p>But I like to think of them as love letters. Books are a labor that takes months, years, and even decades to make. They require much attention, care, devotion and energy to create. And even if you spend the time doing so, you're not guaranteed a result, whether that's many copies sold or accolades or the satisfaction of knowing you've passed on your knowledge to the people who need it.</p>
                <p>It's taking a risk, doing it for its own sake as much as anything else. In short, it's a labor of love. This is why we write, why we read, why we life. For the love of it. The outcomes alone aren't enough. A labor of love gets us through the longhaul.</p>

                        <h2>Acknowledgement Of Country</h2>
                        <p>I acknowledge the folks whose lands I owe my existence to: the Koori people. The traditional owners, storytellers, and first peoples. This land's been tended and lived alongside for millennia with knowledge passed down through generations. What a legacy. May it prevail.</p>
